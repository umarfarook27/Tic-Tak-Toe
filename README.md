# Tic-Tak-Toe
3*3 Grid
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player strategy game typically played on a 3x3 grid. The game is simple yet engaging, making it a popular choice for leisure, education, and as a beginner's programming project.

Objective:
The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their own symbols (either "X" or "O") on the game board.

Game Setup:

The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns placing their symbol ("X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2) on an empty cell of the grid.
Gameplay:

Players take turns making moves, with the first player typically being "X."
Each player places their symbol in an empty cell of the grid during their turn.
The game continues until one of the players achieves a winning combination or the grid is filled, resulting in a draw.
Winning Conditions:
A player wins the game when they have three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game can end in one of the following ways:

Horizontal Win: Three symbols in a row on the same horizontal line.
Vertical Win: Three symbols in a row on the same vertical line.
Diagonal Win: Three symbols in a row diagonally from one corner to another.
Draw (Tie):
If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has formed a winning combination, the game ends in a draw.

Algorithmic Complexity:
Despite its simplicity, Tic-Tac-Toe can be analyzed from a computational standpoint. The game has a finite number of possible positions, and it is possible to create an optimal strategy to either win or force a draw, assuming both players play perfectly. As a result, Tic-Tac-Toe is often used as a teaching tool in computer science and artificial intelligence courses.

Variations:
There are many variations of Tic-Tac-Toe, including larger grid sizes, different win conditions, and even three-dimensional versions. The core concept of forming a line of three remains consistent across these variations.

Tic-Tac-Toe is not only a game but also a simple and accessible platform for learning programming concepts, such as logic, conditionals, loops, and user input handling.
